### Introduction

I made this app just playing around with Flutter understanding it. I believe i have successfully got a general understanding on using this framework and learning how `packages` , `widgets` , `classes` and `states` work in `Flutter` and `Dart`. I might tackle this later on in life building applications that can manage Machines (from remotely) cross platform and cool dashboards.

End Goal is to reproduce a smart app that can control something in my home.

Probably in the style of this below:
